	What Is <strong>Anonymity</strong>?
</h2>
<div class="para"><p>
	Anonymity, the basic definition of this term is “being without a name.” Simply understood someone is anonymous if his/her identity is not known. Psychologically speaking, being anonymous may be perceived as a reduction in the accountability for the actions performed by the person. Anonymity is also associated with privacy as sometimes it is desirable not to have a direct link with a specific entity, though sometimes it is required by law to present an identity before and/or during an action is performed. In the physical world we have different forms of identification, such as Social Security Number (SSN), driving license, passport etc., which are widely acceptable.

<h2>Why Do We Use It?</h2>
<div class="para"><p>There are a number of good reasons for anonymity or shielding one’s identity online. One is to limit or control how personal data is collected and stored, as well as who can access and use it. This helps prevent security breaches, surveillance and intrusive web-tracking.</p></div>

<div class="context"><h2>PROS and CONS</h2>
<div class="para"><p>Anonymity and identity shielding allow a user to hide or disguise their identifying information online.While this protects their privacy, it can make it difficult to hold them responsible for what they say and do online.

<div class="context"><h2>How Should Anonymity Be Regulated?</h2>
<div class="para"><p>States should adopt laws, regulations and policies that grant the power to remove the right to anonymity only to courts, rather than law. States should recognise in their legislation and practices that encryption is a basic requirement for the protection of the confidentiality and security of
information and that, as such, it is essential to the protection of the right to
freedom of expression online;</p></div></div>
