    		This is the first project of the year which we present it to the class for self-introduction. We learned the basic html elements and attributes for example body, paragraph, unordered list, ordered list, and anchor with 'src' attribute attatched. We learned how to add images and put embed video to the webpage. Since this webpage was made before we learned how to use CSS code, spam and style were used widely in the format and color.
